<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Smoking-Room</span>
(<i>continued</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I may</span> assume, that after the terrible
example given in my last chapter, you have firmly made up your mind
never on any account to take service in the great army of bores. But
this determination is not all that is necessary. A man must constantly
keep a strict guard on himself, lest he should unconsciously deviate
even for a few minutes into the regions of boredom. Whatever you do,
let nothing tempt you to relate more than once any grievance you may
have. Nothing of course is more poisonous to the aggrieved one than to
stifle his grievance absolutely. Once, and once only, he may produce
it to his friends. I shall be blamed, perhaps, for making even this
slight concession. Please be careful, therefore, not to abuse it. Is
there in the whole world a more ridiculous sight than a strong,
healthy, well-fed sportsman who wearies his companions one after
another with the depressing recital of his ill-luck, or of the
dastardly behaviour of the head-keeper in not stopping the whole party
for half an hour to search for an imaginary bird, which is supposed to
have fallen stone-dead somewhere or other; or of the iniquities of the
man from whom he bought his cartridges in not loading them with the
right charge; or any of the hundred inconveniences and injuries to
which sportsmen are liable. All these things may be as he says they
are. He may be the most unfortunate, the most unjustly treated of
mankind. But why insist upon it? Why check the current of sympathy by
the dam of constant repetition? And, after all, how trivial and absurd
the whole thing is! Even a man whose career has been ruined by
malicious persecution will be avoided like a pest if it is known that
he dins the account of his wrongs into everyone's ears. How, then,
shall the sufferer by the petty injuries of ordinary sport be listened
to with patience? Of all bores, the grievancemonger is the fiercest
and worst. Lay this great truth by in your memory, and be mindful of
it in more important matters than sport when the occasion arises.</p>

<p>I have been asked to say, whether a man may abuse his gun? I reply
emphatically, no. A gun is not a mere ordinary machine. Its beautiful
arrangement of locks, and springs, and catches, and bolts, and pins,
and screws, its unaccountable perversities, its occasional fits of
sulkiness, its lovely brown complexion, and its capacity both for
kicking and for smoking, all prove that a gun is in reality a sentient
being of a very high order of intelligence. You may be quite certain
that if you abuse your gun, even when you may imagine it to be far out
of earshot, comfortably cleaned and put to roost on its rack, your gun
will resent it. Why are most sportsmen so silent, so <i>distraits</i>
at breakfast? Why do they dally with a scrap of fish, and linger over
the consumption of a small kidney, and drink great draughts of tea to
restore their equilibrium? If you ask them, they will tell you that
it's because they're "just a bit chippy," owing to sitting up late, or
smoking too much, or forgetting to drink a whiskey and soda before
they went to bed. I know better. It is because they incautiously spoke
evil of their guns, and their guns retaliated by haunting their sleep.
I <i>know</i> guns have this power of projecting horrible emanations
of themselves into the slumbers of sportsmen who have not treated them
as they deserved. I have suffered from it myself. It was only last
week that, having said something derogatory to the dignity of my
second gun, I woke with a start at two o'clock in the morning, and
found its wraith going through the most horrible antics in a patch of
moonlight on my bed-room floor. I shot with that gun on the following
day, and missed nearly everything I shot at. Could there be a more
convincing proof? Take my advice, therefore, and abstain from abusing
your gun.</p>

<p>Now your typical smoking-room conversation ought always to include
the following subjects:&#8212;(1) The wrong-headed, unpopular man, whom
every district possesses, and who is always at loggerheads with
somebody; (2) "The best shot in England," who is to be found in every
country-side, and in whose achievements all the sportsmen of his
particular district take a patriotic pride; (3) the folly and
wickedness of those who talk or write ignorantly against any kind of
sport; (4) the deficiency of hares due to the rascally provisions of
the Hares and Rabbits Act; (5) a few reminiscences, slightly
glorified, of the particular day's sport; and (6) a prolonged argument
on the relative merits of the old plan of shooting birds over dogs,
and the modern methods of walking them up or driving. These are not
the only, but certainly the chief ingredients. Let me give you an
example, drawn from my note-book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&#8212;<i>The Smoking-room of a
Country-house in December. Six Sportsmen in Smoking-coats. Time</i>,
11.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p><i>First Sportsman</i> (<i>concluding a harangue</i>). All I can
say is, I never read such rot in all my life. Why, the fellow doesn't
know a gun from a cartridge-bag. I'm perfectly sick of reading that
everlasting rubbish about "pampered minions of the aristocracy
slaughtering the unresisting pheasant in his thousands at battues." I
wonder what the beggars imagine a rocketing pheasant is like? I should
like to have seen one of 'em outside Chivy Wood to-day. I never saw
taller birds in my life. Talk of <i>them</i> being easy! Why, a
pheasant gets ever so much more show for his money when he's beaten
over the guns. If they simply walk him up, he hasn't got a thousand to
one chance. Bah!
<p class="ralign">[<i>Drinks from a long glass.</i></p>

<p><i>Second Sportsman.</i> I saw in some paper the other day what the
President of the United States thought about English battue-shooting.
Seemed to think we shot pheasants perched in the trees, and went on to
say that wasn't the sport for <i>him; he</i> liked to go after his
game, and find it for himself. Who the deuce cares if he does? If he
can't talk better sense than that, no
wonder <span class="smcap">Cleveland</span> beat him in the
election.</p>

<p><i>Third Sp.</i> Pure rubbish, of course. Still I must say, apart
from pheasants, I like the old plan of letting your dogs work. It's
far more sport than walking up partridges in line, or getting them
driven at you.</p>

<p><i>First Sp.</i> My dear fellow, I don't agree with you a bit. In
the first place, as to driving&#8212;driven birds are fifty times more
difficult; and what's the use of wasting time with setters or pointers
in ordinary root-fields. It's all sentiment.</p>

<p>[<i>A long and animated discussion ensues. This particular subject
never fails to provoke a tremendous argument.</i></p>

<p class="caption">(<i>A few minutes later.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Sp.</i> (<i>to the host</i>). What was the bag
to-day, <span class="smcap">Chalmers</span>?</p>

<p><i>Chalmers.</i> A hundred and forty-five pheasants, fifty-six
rabbits, eleven hares, three pigeons, and a woodcock. We should have
got a hundred and eighty pheasants if they hadn't dodged us in the big
wood. I can't make out where they went.</p>

<p><i>Second Sp.</i> It's a deuced difficult wood to beat, that is. I
thought we should have got more hares, all the same.</p>

<p><i>Chalmers.</i> Hares! I think I'm precious lucky to get so many
nowadays. There won't be a hare left in a year or two.</p>

<p class="caption">(<i>The discussion proceeds.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Third Sp.</i> How's old <span class="smcap">Johnny Raikes</span>
shooting this year? I never saw such a chap for rocketers. They can't
escape him.</p>

<p><i>Chalmers.</i> I asked him to-day, but he couldn't come. I think
for pheasants he's quite the best shot in England. Nobody can beat him
at that game.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Sp.</i> Hasn't he got some row or other on
with <span class="smcap">Crackside</span>?</p>

<p><i>Chalmers.</i> Yes. That makes fourteen
rows <span class="smcap">Crackside</span> has got going on all at
once. He seems to revel in them. His latest move was to refuse to pay
tithe, and when the parson levied a distress, he made all his tenants
drunk and walked at their head blowing a post-horn. He's as mad as a
hatter.</p>

<p>So there you have a sample conversation, sketched in outline. You
will find it accurate enough. All you have to do is to select for
yourself the part you mean to play in it.</p>

<p><i>Local Flyman</i> (<i>who also officiates at Funerals</i>).

<p><span class="smcap">Taxes. A Hoarding and Saving
Clause.</span>&#8212;<i>À propos</i> of an article in the <i>Times</i> on
this subject, and a paragraph of <i>Mr. Punch's</i>, last week, anent
"Hoardings," we may now put a supplementary question in this form, "As
Government taxes <i>Savings</i>, would it not be quite consistent to
tax <i>Hoardings</i>?" Since the answer must, logically, be in the
affirmative, let Government begin at once with all the Hoardings
displaying any kind of hideous pictorial advertisement.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>"<span class="smcap">He</span> rumbles so in his conversation,"
observed Mrs. R. of an orator whose sentences were considerably
involved, "that I can seldom catch the grist of what he says."</p>

<hr class="half">

<h2>PRACTICAL THEOSOPHY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Besant</span> is said to have told a
representative of a daily paper, that "an adept in Theosophy uses his
supernatural powers solely for his own convenience, just as ordinary
people avail themselves of a messenger, or the telephone or
telegraph."</p>

<p>We have it on the very best of authority that the discharge of
handbills from aërial bombs is to be entirely surpassed as a method
for advertising a commodity, by a new and protected process.</p>

<p>"A Company is being formed," so runs the prospectus, "for the
express purpose of importing Mahatmas of the very best vintage
(guaranteed <i>extra sec</i>), direct from Thibet, where an
exceptionally luxuriant crop has been produced during past years.</p>

<p>"They will be shipped to any port in the United Kingdom, and
delivered to any address, carriage free, at prices which will compare
most favourably with those quoted by foreign firms for inferior
articles.</p>

<p>"The trade supplied by special contract.</p>

<p>"They will prove invaluable to advertisers and others.</p>

<p>"No family should be without one. Order early.</p>

<p>"They can be used for a variety of purposes; but they will be found
most particularly serviceable for distributing handbills and posters,
especially in inaccessible places.</p>

<p>"<i>Domestic servants entirely superseded by them.</i></p>

<p>"Prompt and accurate delivery of any object may be effected by
their agency, owing to their marvellous powers of precipitation.</p>

<p>"Full instructions for working, and instruments for repairing,
supplied with each specimen.</p>

<p>"Not liable to get out of order.</p>

<p>"Safe in the hands of a child. Yet they are not toys.</p>

<p>"Procurable of any respectable Lunatic Asylum.</p>

<p>"Ask for Our Brand, and see that you get none other.</p>

<p>"Beware of worthless foreign imitations, which dishonest dealers
will try to foist upon you.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of Mahatmas young, and Mahatmas old,</span><br>

</div>
</div>

<p>The financial column of the Journal of the Future, we may expect,
will read somewhat as follows:&#8212;"Mahatmas opened weak, but slowly
advanced a third. Later they became stronger, and closed firm at
8-1/4. Latest&#8212;Mahatmas fell rapidly."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity Begins Abroad.</span>&#8212;The following
advertisement (which recently appeared in the <i>Times</i>) has been
sent for solution:&#8212;</p>

<p class="note">GENTLEMAN, with knowledge of business and disposing of
100,000 francs, is desirous of REPRESENTING, either in Europe, Africa,
America, or elsewhere, a serious FIRM, capable of giving important
profits. Offers to be addressed, &#38;c.</p>

<p>In reply to this appeal, <i>Mr. Punch</i> begs to say that "the
gentleman with knowledge of business" seems to be anxious to act as an
<i>alter ego</i> to a serious (not a jocular) firm "capable of giving
profits." <span class="smcap">"Gentleman"</span> does not specify whose
profits the serious firm is capable of giving, and thus it may be
presumed that the 100,000 francs would form the capital with which the
charitable transaction would be conducted. This is the more probable
as <span class="smcap">"Gentleman"</span> says he knows how to dispose
of them.</p>

an infant's frock, waddles in, hoists herself on the platform and

<h2>"THE SINS OF SOCIETY."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Read,</span> yesterday, in
the <i>Fortnightly</i>, this article
by <span class="smcap">Ouida</span>. Resolved to follow her teachings at
once. Changed my "frightful, grotesque, and disgraceful male costume"
for the most picturesque garments I had&#8212;a kilt, a blue blazer, and a
yellow turban, which I once wore at a fancy dress ball. Then strolled
along Piccadilly to the Club. Rather cool. Having abandoned "the most
vulgar form of salutation, the shake-hands," bowed distantly to several
men I had known for years&#8212;but they looked another way. Met a policeman.
"Hullo!" he said. "Come out o' that! Your place is in the road." He
mistook me for a sandwich-man! Explained that I was advocating a new
style of dress. "Where's yer trousers?" he asked. "Trousers!" I cried.
"Why, <span class="smcap">Ouida</span>"&#8212;but it was useless to explain
to such a fool&#8212;so I left him.</p>

<p>At the Club, immense astonishment. Again explained. Members tapped
their foreheads, and said I had better see the Doctor. Why? Then they
all avoided me. Grand chance to show my ability "to support solitude,
and to endure silence." Deuced dull, but it saved me from "the poisoned
atmosphere of crowded rooms." Began to feel hungry about lunch-time, but
happily remembered that "it is not luxury which is enervating, it is
over-eating." Exhausted, but virtuous. Remembered that I had to dine at
my aunt's. Awkward! Could I go in that dress? She is so prim, and so
prejudiced in favour of trousers. Also she is so rich, and I was her
heir. It needs money to obtain the luxury which the great teacher
advocates. Hurried home, and put on hateful evening dress. Avoided
hansoms, they being too much connected with one "ugly hurry-skurry," and
drove to my aunt's in a damp, dirty four-wheeler. Even the new moralist
herself would have been satisfied with the slowness of that.</p>

<p>At dinner sat between two charming women, evidently as clever as they
were beautiful. Suddenly remembered that we "lose the subtle and fine
flavours of our best dishes, because we consider ourselves obliged to
converse with somebody," and after that did not speak a word. Charming
women stared, and then each turned towards me a beautiful shoulder, and
I saw her face no more. Was just enjoying the flavours when I
recollected that nothing "can make even tolerable, artistically
speaking, the sight of men and women sitting bolt upright close together
taking their soup." We were long past the soup, but it was not too late.
I left the table at once, and reclined elegantly on the floor, with my
plate by my side. "<span class="smcap">Augustus</span>," said my Aunt,
"are you ill?" I shook my head; I could not speak, for I was just
enjoying an unusually subtle flavour. Then one of the guests, a member
of my Club, whispered to my aunt, and tapped his forehead. Then she
tapped her forehead, and all the guests tapped their foreheads. I had
finished that flavour, so I said, "My dear Aunt, I am not mad, I&#8212;&#8212;"
"Then," said she, "you must be intoxicated. Leave the house!" And, with
the butler and the footmen escorting me to the street-door, I was
obliged to do so.</p>

<p>It is all over. I know that my Aunt will bequeath her fortune to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ancient Buildings among the
Jews, but I am consoled by the thought that I, at least, have followed
the noble teachings of the New Morality.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> title of Mr. <span class="smcap">Conan
Doyle's</span> new book, <i>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, is
incomplete without the addition of, "And the D.D., or Dummy Doctor," who
plays a part in the narratives analogous to that of "Charles, his
Friend," on the stage. The book is, in many respects, a thriller,
reminding one somewhat of <i>The Diary of a Late Physician</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Samuel Warren</span>. This volume is handsomely got
up&#8212;too handsomely&#8212;and profusely, too profusely, illustrated. For both
romancer and reader, such stories are better un-illustrated. A
sensational picture attracts, and distracts. In this collection the
Baron can recommend <i>The Beryl Coronet</i>, <i>The Red-Headed
League</i>, <i>The Copper Beeches</i>, and <i>The Speckled Band</i>. The
best time for reading any one of these stories is the last thing at
night, before turning in. "At such an hour, try <i>The Speckled
Band</i>, and see how you like it," says the Bold Baron.</p>

<p>The Baron's assistant dives into the Christmas Card Basket, and
produces <span class="smcap">Raphael Tuck and Sons</span>,&#8212;"Tuck," a
schoolword dear to "our boys,"&#8212;who lead off the Christmas dance.
Daintily and picturesquely got up, their Cards are quite full. Their
Watteau Screens will serve as small ornaments afterwards. These "Correct
Cards," with few exceptions, are not particularly for Christmas, but for
all time. Here's Luck To
<span class="smcap">Raphael Tuck</span>!</p>

<p>"Todgers's could do it when it liked," and so can
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span> &amp; Co. at this Fairy Tale
time, when they bring out three capital books, edited
by <span class="smcap">Alfred H. Miles</span>; <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Fifty-two
Fairy Tales</i>,
<i>Fifty-two other Stories for Boys</i>, and <i>Fifty-two other Stories
for Girls</i>. Why not Fairy Tales for a holiday task, and an
examination in Fairy Lore, with a Fairy Lore Degree for the successful
candidate?</p>

<p>Then come <span class="smcap">Blackie and Sons</span> with Plenty
from <span class="smcap">Henty</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="smcap">G. A.
Henty</span>&#8212;who at Christmas-time is anything but a
"Non-Henty-ty." <i>Beric the Briton</i>, <i>In Greek
Waters</i>, <i>Condemned as a Nihilist!</i>&#8212;"Go
it, <span class="smcap">Henty</span>!" The Baron cheers you onward.</p>

<p><i>The Thirsty Sword</i>, by <span class="smcap">Robert
Leighton</span>. It's a killing story.</p>

<p><i>An Old-Time Yarn</i>, by <span class="smcap">Edgar
Pickering</span>, about the adventures of
<span class="smcap">Drake and Hawkins</span>. <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>, mariner, not Sir <span class="smcap">'Enry</span>, the Judge. New yarn.
Strong old salts&#8212;very refreshing.</p>

<p><i>The Bull Calf</i>, brought out for <span class="smcap">John Bull
Junior's</span> amusement at Christmas, and seasonably illustrated
by <span class="smcap">Frost</span>, is a queer sort of animal of the
Two Macs Donkey breed. Right for <span class="smcap">Nimmo</span> to
have some fun at Christmas, according to old example, "<i>Nimmo
mortalium omnibus horis sapit.</i>"</p>

<p>What's in a name? not the first time this question has been asked and
answered&#8212;but 'tis impossible for the Baron to avoid quoting it now,
when in consequence of its title, he was within an ace of putting aside
<i>The Germ Growers</i>, under the impression that it was a scientific
work on Bacillus and Phylloxera. On taking it up, however, the Baron
soon became deeply interested, but was subsequently annoyed to find how
the artful author had beguiled him by leading up to a kind of imitation
of the <i>In hoc Signo vinces</i> legend, and had somewhat adroitly
adapted to his purpose the imagery of one of the most poetic and sublime
of ancient Scripture narratives; <i>i.e.</i>, where the prophet sees the
chariots of Israel in the air. One remarkable thing about the romance is
the absence of "love-motive," and, indeed, the absence of all female
interest. Here and there the Canon writes carelessly, as instance the
following paragraph:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Then he got a little glass-tube into which he put something out of a
very small bottle, which he took from a number of others which lay side
by side in a little case which he took out of a pocket in the side of
the car."</p></blockquote>

<p>Apart from other faults, there are too many "whiches" here, and
unlike his malignant hero, <i>Davoli</i>, the Canon doesn't seem to be
well up in his "which-craft." Clever
Canon <span class="smcap">Potter</span> must turn out from his Potteries
some ware superior to this for the public and</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Reflection in the Mist</span>.&#8212;You
could have "cut the fog, it was so thick," is a common expression. But
the fog, unwelcome as it always is, is not like an unwelcome
acquaintance, who can be "cut" or avoided by turning down a street, or
by pretending unconsciousness of his proximity.</p></blockquote>

<h2>FACT, OR FUNK?</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&#8212;Will you permit me to protest
against the shocking insecurity of life and property in London? What are
the Police doing? Only yesterday I was walking, <i>in the middle of the
day</i>, in a rather quiet road in this suburb, when a <i>highway
robber</i>, disguised as an ordinary beggar, asked me for a copper! His
look was <i>most forbidding</i>, and he put his hand under his coat in a
way that convinced me he was about to <i>draw a revolver</i>! I at once
gave him my purse, with half-a-crown in it, which seemed to pacify him,
and I am convinced that I owe my life to my <i>presence of mind</i>. The
shock, however, has quite prostrated me, and my medical adviser has
already paid me <i>three visits</i>, on the strength of it, and says I
need "careful watching for some time." He has very kindly put off a
holiday, in order to watch me, which is sufficient to prove what
a <i>diabolical outrage</i> I have been the victim of!</p>

<h2>THE NEXT ELECTION PIC-NIC.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(<i>By Our Own Prophetic Reporter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days since a "Grand Intellectual
<i>Fête</i>" was given by the Flower League in advancement of the
Patriotic Cause, in the grounds of the Duke of <span
class="smcap">Ditchwater</span>. The Railway Companies afforded unusual
facilities for securing a large gathering, and there was much enthusiasm
amongst those who were present. To meet the requirements of decisions
arrived at during the trial of recent Election Petitions, it was
arranged that some one competent to undertake the task should introduce
and explain the various distractions afforded for the entertainment of
the very numerous company. Mr. A. <span class="smcap">Briefless</span>,
<span class="smcap">Junior</span>, Barrister, of London, kindly
consented to act as lecturer, his professional engagements fortunately
allowing him leisure to assume such a responsibility.</p>

<p>The Lecturer said that he was delighted to see so large a gathering.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) They quite reminded him of the clients who thronged his
passage on the first day of Term, waiting for his chamber doors to open.
(<i>Laughter.</i>) There was nothing in the remark he had just made to
provoke merriment. He wished it to be clearly understood that he
appealed to their reason. (<i>Cheers.</i>) It had been objected that
some of the entertainments given at what had been called political
pic-nics had nothing to do with the reasoning faculties of the
spectators. This he emphatically denied. (<i>Applause.</i>) Without
wasting further of their time&#8212;(<i>"No, no!" "Go on."</i>)&#8212;he would
come to his first illustration&#8212;the Bounding Brothers of Bohemia.
(<i>Great cheering.</i>) It was advisable that the bodies as well as the
minds of children educated by the School-Boards should receive
attention. Their bodies should be brought to as near perfection as
possible; every muscle should be brought into play. To explain his
meaning, he called upon the Bounding Brothers of Bohemia to illustrate
the poetry of motion.</p>

<p>Upon this, five gentlemen in tights (understood to be the athletic
kindred to whom the Lecturer had referred) performed a series of feats
of strength, which included standing on one another's heads, jumping
through hoops, and turning quadruple somersaults.</p>

<p>After their performances were over Mr. <span
class="smcap">Briefless</span> resumed.</p>

<p>The Lecturer said: He next wished to appeal to their reason&#8212;to
challenge, so to speak, their senses on the power of foreign opinion. It
was asserted that an Englishman cared only for his native land and the
Press appertaining thereto. Now he (the Lecturer) had the greatest
respect for the English Press&#8212;(<i>cheers</i>)&#8212;still he found that some
of our foreign contemporaries were nearly as good. (<i>"Hear,
hear!"</i>) He wished to introduce the Signora <span
class="smcap">Mantilla</span> from Spain&#8212;(<i>applause</i>)&#8212;who had
consented to sing a political song in Spanish, emphasizing her opinions
by a dance after each verse. (<i>Great cheering.</i>) The Signora <span
class="smcap">Mantilla</span> then gave a demonstration, which was much
appreciated.</p>

<p>The Lecturer resumed. He said he had not insulted their intelligence
by asking them if they understood Spanish. Of course, they did. (<i>Loud
laughter.</i>) He was quite sure that the Signora's third verse and
accompanying dance must have convinced everyone of the advantages of
Fair Trade. (<i>Laughter.</i>) He saw no reason for merriment.
(<i>Renewed laughter.</i>) He had now come to that important subject
Bi-metallism. (<i>Cheers.</i>) They had been told that whereas speech
was silver, silence was golden. (<i>"Hear, hear!"</i>) To show the
advantage of silver (represented by speech), the Blue-eyed Nigger would
give a native song accompanied on his own banjo. (<i>Loud
applause.</i>)</p>

<p>The Blue-eyed Nigger then favoured the company with one of his
characteristic ditties.</p>

<p>The Lecturer said he had now to thank his audience for their kind
attention, and to inform them that the display of fireworks with
set-pieces containing political sentiments appealing to their reason,
would take place immediately.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the company separated, greatly pleased with the
rational entertainment they had been invited to enjoy.</p>

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">National Art-Treasures.</span>&#8212;I see that
objections are being made to Millbank as a suitable site for the Picture
Gallery which Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span> has so generously
offered to the nation. May I ask whether the advantages of the Isle of
Dogs have ever been considered? The position being right out of the way
of anybody who cares a rush for Art, and in the centre of the river-fog
district, so as to ensure a maximum of injury to the pictures by damp,
its offer to the generous donor would convincingly demonstrate our
Government's appreciation of such patriotic munificence. Failing the
Isle of Dogs, would there be any objection to Barking, in the
neighbourhood of the Sewage Outfall? They are quite accustomed there to
dealing with the precipitation of sludge. Perhaps some Art-lover would
reply.</p>

pursue under the following awkward circumstances? I live in a house in a
newly-constructed terrace, with very thin party-walls. The tenant on one
side has just set up a private establishment for the reception of the
most thoroughly incurable class of maniacs, while on the other side is a
family who make their living by piano, violin, and cornet performances,
at private houses. I have asked the landlord to abate the nuisance by
adding another brick to the thickness of the walls on each side; but he
writes to me, giving his address at the Bankruptcy Court, to explain
that the houses are not so constructed as to bear the extra weight,
which I think very probable. I would apply for an injunction against the
Maniacs, were it not that their howlings are sometimes useful in
drowning the sound of the constant practising on the piano. Would it be
wise to retaliate by dropping bricks at midnight down my neighbours'
chimneys? What is the least term of Penal Servitude that I could get if
I hired some of the Unemployed to break into the musical house and smash
up the instruments? If I went as a Deputation on the subject to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Asquith</span>, should I be likely to be cordially
received?</p>
